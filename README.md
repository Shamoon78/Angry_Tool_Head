# Angry_Tool_Head

# A tool head for Monolith gantry for voron 3d printers 

# Can easly be adapted to any other gantry with front Mgn9 rail on X axis , Using Mgn12 rail and 2020 extrusion on X axis is pointless with this tool head, because this tool head is meant to solve the problem with MGn9 rail and x-beam lower tortional regidity by moving COG close to the carriage, using Mgn12 can give good results with any other tool heads because of it is higher tortional regidity,though lower IS . The tool head have integrated extruder again to increase regidity because most of  the tool heads are designed with flipy flop extruder mount. the integrated extruder have fixed idler, and it is not accessible after assymbly so make sure the gears are moving freely by passing filament through before the stepper motor is mounted .though it will unless in one case you have shitty print .

# I recommend use any filled filaments like PCCF, ASACF ,ABSCF.some parts need support, Any tight passing through screw is meant to be like that, to increase regidity , so be patient and donot drill the holes ,YOU have to figure the list of screws required which are different lengths of M3, only 2 screws used are m2 to mount gear idler also have to be different lengths . Putting the idler cap and fitting the hotend heatsink is also meant to be very tight tolernace ,and need patience to fit in,if it is loose to fit gain you have shitty prints (flow not calibrated well).

# You need REDGA bondteck gear set or even the none inegrated gear with pin screw. can be used . Also need 25mm fan .

# Now go start assymbly of your new tool head and clean your fealthy and dirty IS graphs. Coming soon Orbitor 2 gears and after canon gears.

# Make sure you remove the filament from the gear area before dissambly otherwise noway taking the gears out .

# Vedio coming soon to explain assymbly and the screws length used.
